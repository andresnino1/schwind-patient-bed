Develop a Schwind Amaris patient bed detector when the laser is connected with the VisuMax

This project was created to solve the problem that the Schwind Amaris has when it is connected to the Zeiss VisuMax laser.

I develop a patient bed detection, using an ultrasonic system in order to monitoring the right position of the VisuMax patient bed.

The goal of the project was:
- Determine which pins are the responsible of the patient bed on surgical position
- Determine which pins are the responsible of the Righ and Left Eye position
- Develop a electronic system that send an ultrasoci signal in order to check the right position of the patient bed
- Program de code in the embeded system in order to set up the middle position of the patient bed.
- Develop the PCB layaut of the circuit
- Test the final proyect on the machine.
